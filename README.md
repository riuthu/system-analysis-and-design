Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project aims to design and develop a comprehensive system for the client, DriverPass, to improve their driver student training system. The client wants an online platform that offers practice exams and on-the-road training to help students pass their driving tests and reduce the current failure rate of 65%. The system serves multiple parties, including students, administrators, instructors, and IT personnel.

What did you do particularly well?
Things I consider my strengths in the project include narrowing the functional and nonfunctional requirements, identifying the client needs from the driverpass project, and the illustration of the UML diagram. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one project it would be the business requirement since a Gantt Chart is incomplete in the project. Giving an accurate timeline of the project lays the foundation of the project success and the lack of Gantt Chart which gives an overview of the timeline, adding a chart would complete the business requirement. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs for the DriverPass project involves understanding the objectives of students, instructors, and administrators. The users’ needs were interpreted by understanding the needs of the client and using existing data to guide the necessary user’s needs. Implementing these needs into the system design ensures that the platform addresses their challenges and provides an efficient way to manage driving lessons, reservations, online classes, practice tests, and user data.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
To approach designing software for the DriverPass project, I would use the following strategies, requirements gathering, then system architecture and prioritize a user centered design, utilize agile method, and finally focus on security, performance and scalability.
